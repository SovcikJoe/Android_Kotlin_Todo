# Android_Kotlin_Todo
Todo-app used to experiment with different features of Kotlin and for learning purposes.

Please **let me know if I am doing something badly** or if there is a way to improve something.

Best way is to contact me on Slack or just raise an Issue here so we can discuss and other people could find the conversation afterwards.
